# clox
An implementation of the `clox` VM and interpreter from the book _Crafting Interpreters_ by Robert Nystrom.

This implementation in C is taken directly from the book and should be identical to the text, except for a few minor changes. At the very least, it passes all unit tests provided by the book's author! (see https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)
